    <div class="class3"><h2>Parental leave</h2>
    <p>A lot of us have families, of all sorts of shapes
    and sizes, and we welcome each new addition
    with generous parental leave and "bonding
    leave".

    <div class="class5"><h2>Happier weekdays</h2>
    <p>A culture light on meetings (or that's our aim, at
    least) with guest speakers and opportunities to
    get to know your team better through events
    like weekly catered lunches and breakfasts,
    Thursday Socials and game nights. But we don't
    stay in the office 24/7.
